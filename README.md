## FastCRUD 
Autogeneration of Boilerplate code

## What does this library do? 
In a Nutshell this is a cli-tool for 
a fastAPI backend. You can generate your 
pydantic models, your db models, routers. 
The idea is to give you a starting point without 
having to write all the boilerplate from scratch. 
From there you can configure & add as you please. The goal is not to be super opinionated but to automate some of the less fun stuff.
